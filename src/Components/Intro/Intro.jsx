    <p>From learning to read at age three, to getting my Girl Scout Bronze, 
    Silver and Gold Awards, I have always been an avid learner. In high school,
    I took two years of a Practicum Education and Training with four
    internships in educational settings. I continued my education with a Bachelors of
    Science in Educational Studies. I developed my interpersonal skills
    in four more internships, this time focused less on traditional childhood
    education, and instead, in and around my local community.</p></div>
