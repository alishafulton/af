    to assess customer needs and collaborate with others to achieve goals. 
    Now, I've transitioned into UX/UI, where I can hone both my interpersonal 
    skills and my creative talent to help brands develop and nurture customer 
    relationships through technology. With a background in education, I have 
    confidence in on-the-spot problem solving, as well as high levels of emotional 
    intelligence that I hope to bring to any team. I am excited to find a UX/UI Design 
    role that will leverage my customer-centric experience, foster my eagerness to learn, 
    and allow me to create designs that will improve everyday user experiences.</div>
