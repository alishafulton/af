        I am a lifelong learner of education and psychology, understanding of human motivations and desires, and an empathic and active listener who has had years of observational research of others. I am grateful to constantly grow my technology knowledge online. I consider myself to be self-taught on a wide variety of subjects and have taken computer science classes, ux courses through Google and Coursera, and am always challenging myself to learn more. I would be more than thrilled to discuss how my years of retail experience, my degree in education and my obsession with design in technology are all a part of what makes me an incredible user experience designer.
