Hello! 

This is my repository that holds my portfolio :)

I created this repository to better understand the connection between a design prototype and turning it into a coded project. I learn best by doing, and since most of coding is just problem-solving, a lot of this code was simply pieced together via educated-guess-and-check (shout out Inspect Element!). My code may not be perfect and I'm still learning, but I gained so much confidence in the way that I design. Knowing what is important in the long run can speed up processes immensely!

If you see an error, or even a simpler way to code, I would love to learn from you! Send me a message through my website contact form, or find me on LinkedIn.

Thanks! :)
